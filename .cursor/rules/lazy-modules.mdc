### ANGULAR LAZY LOADED MODULES WITH NX LIBRARIES

To add a new feature as lazy-loaded module, follow steps:

1. Use NX tool to create new NX library in `libs/features` folder
2. New library should be created in buildable mode


in library `src/lib` directory create file `routes.ts` that exports routes from this library
```typescript
export const DASHBOARD_ROUTES: Route[] = [
  {
    path: '',
    pathMatch: 'full',
    component: DashboardComponent
  },
];
```
NX library should encapsulate all code and exports only from `routes.ts` in `indes.ts`

Then in `app.routes.ts` in APP import in this way
```typescript
export const appRoutes: Route[] = [  
  {
    path: 'dashboard',
    loadChildren: () => import('@cpmpany/features/dashboard').then(m => m.DASHBOARD_ROUTES)
  }, 
];
```


Don't create a directory for main feature component. Put it in `src/lid/` directory
