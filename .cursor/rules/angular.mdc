- Leverage functional guards and resolvers instead of class-based ones
- Use the new deferrable views for improved loading states
- Implement OnPush change detection strategy for improved performance
- Use TypeScript decorators with explicit visibility modifiers (public, private)
- Leverage Angular CLI for schematics and code generation
- Implement proper lazy loading with loadComponent and loadChildren


#### ANGULAR_MATERIAL
